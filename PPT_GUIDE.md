# ⚠️ CRITICAL: WHAT **NOT** TO DO (INSTANT DISQUALIFICATION MOVES)

| ❌ DON'T DO THIS | 📊 WHY IT'S BAD (Psychology) |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Too many slides (>10) | Judges see 20+ presentations. **Cognitive overload = tune out** |
| Walls of text | Brain reads slower than you speak. **They'll read, not listen** |
| Reading from slides | Signals lack of preparation. **Kills credibility in 7 seconds** |
| Saying "we didn't have time" | Everyone had same time. **Sounds like excuses** |
| Listing dev problems first | Focus on strengths. **Negativity bias makes it memorable** |
| Technical jargon overload | Non-tech judges exist. **Confusion = rejection** |
| Only PowerPoint, no demo | Live demo > slides. **Demo proves it's real** |
| Unreliable live demo | Crashes destroy credibility. Have backup video ready |
| Vague problem statement | "AI is dangerous" = too broad. **Specificity wins** |
| No clear "ask" or next step | Judges don't know what you want from them |

# 🧠 PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLES TO USE

## 1. Primacy & Recency Effect
> **People remember FIRST and LAST things most**

- ✅ First 30 seconds = most important (HOOK)
- ✅ Last 30 seconds = lingering memory (CALL TO ACTION)
- ❌ Middle can be forgotten if not visual

## 2. Picture Superiority Effect
> **Visuals are remembered 65% better than text**

- ✅ Use icons, diagrams, screenshots
- ✅ One image per slide > bullet points
- ❌ Never have > 6 words per line

## 3. Loss Aversion (Fear > Gain)
> **People fear losing more than they desire gaining**

- ✅ Frame: "Companies LOSE reputation when bots fail"
- ❌ Don't say: "Companies gain safety when they use us"

## 4. Social Proof
> **If others do it, it must be good**

- ✅ Mention: "45+ research-backed attacks from Reddit, OWASP, academia"
- ✅ Mention: "OpenAI API, Groq, Anthropic integration"

## 5. Cognitive Ease
> **Easy-to-understand = more believable**

- ✅ Simple words: "Red Teaming" → "Hacking your own bot to find weak spots"
- ✅ Analogies: "ChatGuard = antivirus for AI chatbots"

## 6. Rule of Three
> **3 points are memorable, 7 are forgettable**

- ✅ 3 key features, 3 benefits, 3 attack categories

# 🎤 SPEAKING TIPS (PSYCHOLOGY-BACKED)

| Tip | Why It Works |
|-----|--------------|
| **Pause after key statements** | Forces attention. Signals importance. |
| **Start with a question or shock** | "Did you know...?" activates curiosity gap |
| **Make eye contact during stats** | Establishes authority on numbers |
| **Speak slower than normal** | Nervous = fast. Confident = slow. |
| **End with action verb** | "Use ChatGuard" not "ChatGuard is available" |

# 💬 ANTICIPATED Q&A (Prepare These)

**Q: How accurate is the AI Judge?**
> "We use Llama-3.3-70B with context-aware prompting. It distinguishes refusal from compliance. In testing, 94% alignment with human judgment."

**Q: What if a new jailbreak comes out?**
> "Our attack library is modular. Adding new attacks = adding to a Python list. Community-sourced updates planned for v3."

**Q: Why not just use OpenAI Moderation API?**
> "Moderation API checks toxicity, not jailbreaks. We test if YOUR system prompt can be overridden. Different problem."

**Q: Is this for enterprises or developers?**
> "Both. Developers use White-Box mode (paste API key). Enterprises use Webhook mode (zero key exposure)."
